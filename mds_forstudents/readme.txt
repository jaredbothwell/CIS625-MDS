In this folder are:

- python script - this one runs the MDS using a csv as input (which as of now is hard-coded).
You will need to make a virtual environment to run this one, so make sure you got all the python pakages the script needs
- bash script - this is to submit the job to the scheduler
- XX_mini.csv - these are two toy datasets for you to use. each has 50 rows and 5 columns in it. i can make other toy datasets as needed.
